I'm new to Spring boot so most of this is based heavily on examples and auto generated projects. I
spent most of the time I allocated to this divided between learning how things were put together 
and working while I got something simple working. I then spent the remaining time cleaning it.
Were I to put more time into this, I would have researched how to add automated test to what I have 
put in and beyond that, I would have looked to add more functionality. My initial thoughts would be to 
expand access to subSample information. Though that is based on my initial overlook of the api and
I may have chosen to do something else if it looked more useful.
